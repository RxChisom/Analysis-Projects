The goal of the analysis is to visualize and interpret results based on analysis to determine the make versus buy decision for many products using
requested quotes from suppliers
BUY ANALYSIS
This is to see if we are to buy instead of make
From the first visualisation, the unit cost decreases with increase in volume , this satisfies the economies of scale
Next up is to look at extended cost and full cost for each supplier
The goal of my visualisation will be to show supplier name with the lowestcost for part number and quote volume combination, the full cost breakdown by 
extended and full cost, and visibility of all supplier quotes and full cost for the part number.
