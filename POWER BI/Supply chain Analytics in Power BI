The goal of the analysis is to visualize and interpret results based on analysis to determine the make versus buy decision for many products using
requested quotes from suppliers
BUY ANALYSIS
This is to see if we are to buy instead of make
From the first visualisation, the unit cost decreases with increase in volume , this satisfies the economies of scale
Next up is to look at extended cost and full cost for each supplier
The goal of my visualisation will be to show supplier name with the lowestcost for part number and quote volume combination, the full cost breakdown by 
extended and full cost, and visibility of all supplier quotes and full cost for the part number.

Now through a scenario, we are using DAX to calculate full cost for wider range of production volumes, using this formula
scenario full cost = MINX(filter('Supplier (Quotes)','scenario volume'[Value]>='Supplier (Quotes)'[Volume]),'Supplier (Quotes)'[Unit_Cost]*'scenario volume'[Value] + 'Supplier (Quotes)'[Non_recurring_expenses])
Visualising this data by planning a scenario planner report

Supposing marketing projects the demand for a product to be 48000 units, from the data it will be more rational to order up to 50000 to reduce full cost by 10%

MAKE ANALYSIS
I created a dax measure called additional capacity to show gap between existing capacity and scenario volume value
additional unit capacity required = minx('Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)', max('scenario volume'[scenario volume value]-'Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)'[Existing_Capacity],0))

Then i created capital investment required measure using this formula
capital investment required = minx('Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)',roundup([additional unit capacity required]/min('Machine_Mod(Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)'[Unit_Capacity]),0) * 'Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)'[Machine_Fixed_Cost])
Then calculating the make scenario cost 
using formula= minx('Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)',[capital investment required]+'Machine_Model (Internal_Mfg_Resource_Estimates)'[Cost_per_Unit] * 'scenario volume'[scenario volume value])
using the same formula for scenario full cost , we create a measure called buy scenario full cost
and then finaaly creating measure for cost avoidance using the formula
cost avoidanceabs([Make scenario full cost]-[buy scenario full cost])
Make vs buy measure using if function
Make vs buy = if(ISBLANK([Make scenario full cost]),BLANK(),if([Make scenario full cost]>=[buy scenario full cost],"buy","make"))
Yield rate for each company was created to compare scenario volume related to the yield rate of each company

Hope you enjoyed my thought process
Dataset was from Data Camp from practiing their case studies
